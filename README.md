# React Design Systems

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@agentience/react-design-systems-mcp.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agentience/react-design-systems-mcp)

React Design Systems is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides comprehensive information about design systems created for React. The current version focuses exclusively on the AWS Cloudscape Design System components, along with code generation capabilities. It's built using the FastMCP framework and TypeScript.

Future versions will expand to support additional popular React design systems including Material UI, Chakra UI, Ant Design, Blueprint, and Mantine.

```

## Claude Desktop Configuration

To use React Design Systems with Claude Desktop, you can configure it as an MCP server using the published package. This allows Claude Desktop to automatically launch the server when needed.

### Configuration File

Add the following configuration to your Claude Desktop MCP settings file:

**Location:**
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "react-design-systems": {
      "command": "pnpm",
      "args": [
        "dlx",
        "@agentience/react-design-systems-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Command Line Parameters

The server supports the following command line parameters:

- `--transport <type>` or `-t <type>`: Transport type (`stdio` or `sse`). Default: `stdio`
- `--port <number>` or `-p <number>`: Port for SSE transport. Default: `3001`
- `--bind <address>` or `-b <address>`: Bind address for SSE transport. Default: `0.0.0.0`

### Using with Claude

For optimal results when using this MCP server with Claude, consider using a specialized system prompt. We provide an example system prompt that configures Claude as an expert Cloudscape developer with AWS Amplify Gen 2 knowledge. See [Claude Cloudscape & Amplify Expert](prompts/claude-cloudscape-amplify-prompt.md) for details.

### Advanced Configuration Examples

#### With Custom Parameters

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "react-design-systems": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@agentience/react-design-systems-mcp",
        "--transport",
        "stdio"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Using Local Installation

If you have the package installed globally or locally:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "react-design-systems": {
      "command": "react-design-systems-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Development Configuration

For development with a local build:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "react-design-systems": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/react-design-systems-mcp/dist/server.js"
      ],
      "cwd": "/path/to/react-design-systems-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Verification

After adding the configuration:

1. Restart Claude Desktop
2. Start a new conversation
3. The React Design Systems MCP server should be automatically available
4. You can use tools like `search_components` to verify the connection

For troubleshooting connection issues, see the [MCP Protocol Guide](docs/mcp-protocol-guide.md).

- **Material UI**: Comprehensive support for Google's Material Design implementation for React
- **Chakra UI**: Component-focused support for the accessible and customizable Chakra UI library
- **Ant Design**: Enterprise-grade UI system for React applications
- **Blueprint**: Support for Palantir's UI toolkit for web applications
- **Mantine**: Modern React components with excellent dark mode support
